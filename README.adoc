= GitHub Repository Report Creator

A simple tool to create a report with GitHub Organization repository list and attributes.

What it currently can do:

* Cashes all responses, so data is not re-downloaded when restarted.
* Skips archived repositories.
* Adds the following attributes to the report:
    ** Description,
    ** Uses Jenkins (by checking if there's `Jenkinsfile` in the repository root,
    ** Uses GitHub Actions (by checking if there's anything in `.github/workflows`),
    ** If it's a Gradle build (by checking if there is a `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` file in the repository root),
    ** Languages used in the project,
    ** Private or Public,
    ** Archived or not (currently, always `FALSE` since we are skipping those to preserve API calls),
    ** Last repository update date
